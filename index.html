    <h1>Welcome to The World Within</h1>
    <p>Your space for reflection, healing, and growth.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      The World Within started off as a moment at a PG in Bangalore — trying to
      understand big words like passion, goals, and long-term plans, in the little
      time that existed after a data juggling job.
    </p>

    <p>
      The World Within came to pen and paper like any heartbroken person’s next
      phase of life: “Self-care, understand life, and change the world around you
      through your experiences.” The intentions were very raw in the initial phase.
      It reached WordPress and continued with online courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, after years, it learned about formal education and then tried to fit
      in the psychology of these experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      It now defines itself as a safe space that holds stories of grief, pain,
      trauma, oppression, unexpressed emotions, thoughts about the universe, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      “The World Within,” as the name says, is a large part of us that shows up
      within our bodies. How can one become present for it? Bring awareness to it?
      And honor it with gentleness? It is what the space could provide.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we continue to live in the world outside as a part of survival, the
      world within is an intention to integrate one’s lived experiences, stories
      from the outside, and responses to these — all of it to exist under the roof
      of therapy.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Buddhist teachings, the boundary between the mind and the world
      is actually thin, porous, and ultimately illusory. The world is not
      objectively joyful or sad; it produces a corresponding feeling in us.
      Rather, feelings originate within us, projecting their subjective experience
      onto the world. The world isn’t inherently joyful or sad; it just is.
    </p>

    <p>
      This relational space is better understood when we find ways to slow down
      and be in all three — the within, the world, and the interaction of the two.
