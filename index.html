  <h2>Know Your Therapist</h2>

  <h3>The Fundamentals</h3>
  <p>
    Dr. Swetha Turlapati, Psychotherapist by experiential learning. Masters of Counseling Psychology and a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm D) with a postgraduate degree.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a trained and certified practitioner in mindfulness, narrative, and IMAGO (couple therapy) approaches. I’m informed by trauma in my sessions with clients.
    Other trainings include queer affirmative counseling practice (QACP), solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT), and Community Mental Health.
  </p>

  <h3>Therapeutic Relationship</h3>
  <p>
    I believe that collaboration and presence are at the core of a therapeutic relationship. Vulnerability, making space for moment-to-moment emotions, and sensitivity toward culture and systemic oppression are integral to my work.
  </p>

  <h3>My Vitamins</h3>
  <p>
    Co-learning spaces are what I look forward to in my journey as a therapist. I integrate client stories with theory, reflection, and supervision.
    My background as a patient counselor helps me hold awareness of the interaction between physical and mental health.
  </p>

  <h3>Calling Towards Communities</h3>
  <p>
    Community mental health has always been an integral part of my work. I have worked with NGOs, hospitals, schools, colleges, and corporates.
    Topics include stress management, mental health awareness, women’s mental health, mindful living, anxiety, depression, and medically unexplained symptoms.
  </p>

  <h3>I Wake Up To</h3>
  <p>
    Developing a connection to the client’s inner world — mind and body — brings calmness to my practice.
    I believe that conversation with oneself leads to one’s authentic, higher self.

  <h2>Stories</h2>

  <div class="review">
    <p>
      I scheduled a session with Swetha at one of the most turbulent times in my life. I cried and laughed with her.
      Over two years, she helped me understand anxiety, panic, and myself.
      Therapy, for me, became a space to find tools — not answers — and that made all the difference.
    </p>

  <div class="review">
    <p>
      Dr. Swetha is not just a wonderful psychologist, she is a very good human being.
      Her therapy helped me understand my thinking patterns and guided me toward healing from anxiety and depression.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="review">
    <p>
      She is an extremely patient listener who helps you realise the root cause of what you feel.
      That clarity itself is powerful.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="review">
    <p>
      I never believed therapy could help addiction — until I met Dr. Swetha.
      The Pause for Perspective is a must-visit space for the modern human.
    </p>

    <p>
      It felt very comfortable speaking with her. She gave me space, asked relevant questions,
      and helped me organise my thoughts. Every minute felt worth it.
